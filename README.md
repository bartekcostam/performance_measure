# Roadmap

## Version 1.0 - Basic Web Page Performance Testing

In this initial version, the application will provide a robust set of features for testing the performance of any web page. The key features will include:

- **Web Page Loading Speed Test**: The application will be able to test the loading speed of any given web page. This will help users understand how quickly their web pages are loading and identify any potential bottlenecks.

- **Element Availability Test**: Users will be able to specify an XPath for a particular element on the web page. The application will then measure the time it takes for this element to become available. This can help users understand how different elements on their page are affecting the overall load time.

- **Loop Testing**: Users will be able to specify the number of iterations for the test. This will allow users to conduct repeated tests to get a more accurate measure of their web page's performance.

- **Internet Speed Simulation**: The application will simulate different internet speeds for tests. This will help users understand how their web page performs under different network conditions.

- **Data Recording and Visualization**: All test results will be saved in a .csv file for further analysis. Additionally, the application will generate a diagram to visualize the test results.

## Version 2.0 - Advanced Testing with VPN and Database Comparison

Building on the features of Version 1.0, the second version of the application will introduce advanced testing capabilities:

- **VPN Connection**: The application will be able to use a VPN connection for testing. This will allow users to test their web page's performance from different geographical locations.

- **Database Record Comparison**: The application will be able to compare records from a database with the data displayed on the front end of the web application being tested. This will help users ensure that their web application is displaying the correct data.

## Version 3.0 - Enhanced User Experience and Additional Features

In the third version, we aim to enhance the user experience and add more features based on user feedback and market trends. While the exact features will be determined closer to development, potential enhancements could include:

- **Improved GUI**: An enhanced graphical user interface (GUI) for a more intuitive and user-friendly experience.

- **Additional Testing Parameters**: More options for customizing tests, such as testing different user paths, simulating different devices, etc.

- **Integration with Other Tools**: Potential integration with other testing and development tools to provide a more comprehensive testing solution.

- **Automated Testing**: The ability to schedule automated tests at regular intervals.

This roadmap provides a high-level overview of the planned development for the application. As we continue to gather feedback and learn more about our users' needs, we will adjust and update the roadmap accordingly. We are excited about the journey ahead and look forward to delivering a valuable tool for web performance testing.
